# Registration-Authentication## About the Project  - This project was created in order for me to deal with a User registration and a User login. It allowed me to better understand how to pass a User throughout pages, whether they are logged in or not and how to give them access to certain pages and to remove access from other ones. This goes a bit into the authorization part of a User but this project mostly focuses on registration and authentication which is why authorization is not included in the title. This project also allows me to have a registration and login page for other projects I may want to create, it's already all implemented here so it would just be refactored into another project.## Home Page  - The home page just provides information about why I created this project, the ideas behind the creation of the project and the technologies I used inside of the project.  - The current picture is how the home page looks while a User is not logged in, the navigation bar is the main difference, it gives users a link to the Signup page if they do not have an account and a link to the Login page if they already are registered.[![lu7y-LK1d-S2-KQh-Xp97-Xuuqw.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qqGc11PW/lu7y-LK1d-S2-KQh-Xp97-Xuuqw.png)](https://postimg.cc/wR7svQTk)## Signup Page  - The signup page allows a User to register for an account which they use an email address for their login instead of a username.  - The signup page has frontend and backend validation to guarantee that users fill the form out fully, correctly and are not allowed to fill out the form with malicious or incorrect info. Incorrect info could be an email address that's not formatted properly, or the email address already exists, a name which contains numbers or characters that should not be in a name such as "%" or "#", or a password that doesn't meet the length requirement.  - The page will give Users error messages which inform them on the errors in the form such as if a first name is missing it will say, "Error! You must have a first name", and so on for all the other errors.  - On a successful signup a user will be redirected to the login page with a success message which informs them that their signup was successful and the information inputted was valid.  - The signup page also has a link at the bottom of the container that allows you to go to the login page if you already have an account.[![Mgb-U6s-QKScu-L2-F8vu0yr-Rg.png](https://i.postimg.cc/L80znYBK/Mgb-U6s-QKScu-L2-F8vu0yr-Rg.png)](https://postimg.cc/TKgysP4C)## Login Page  - The login page allows a User to login to an existing account which uses the email address and the password used at signup to validate and authenticate a User into their account.  - The login page also includes frontend and backend validation for missing fields, invalid fields, incorrect information and so on. The page also include error messages that do not give too much information about the error unless it is an obvious error. What this means is that someone who tries to login using a valid email and an invalid password will only be informed that either the email or password is incorrect, not if the email is valid or the password is valid. This is to avoid malicious users who are trying to login to other accounts.  - On a successful login a user will be redirected to their dashboard with a success message informing them that they were successfully logged into their account.  - The login page also include a link to the signup page at the bottom of the container to send a user to the signup page if they do not have an account already.[![Y33-Zp-WAYQXKECWCt75tx-A.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GtcBMdJx/Y33-Zp-WAYQXKECWCt75tx-A.png)](https://postimg.cc/zbcXvmQy)## Dashboard Page  - The dashboard page is just the dashboard of the User who logged in, it just gives them info about their account, it includes their name, email and password but it shows the encrypted version of their password.  - The navigation bar also changes when a User is logged in, it only gives them the option to view the homepage, their dashboard and a button for the User to logout. The website also includes some authorization so it doesn't allow a user to view the signup or login page when a User is logged in since they shouldn't be authorized to view those pages once they are already logged in. Those pages should only be accessed when a User is not logged in. The dashboard page also works the same, a User cannot access the dashboard page unless they are logged in, if a user tries to access the dashboard they will just be sent to the home page.  - Upon clicking logout, a User will be logged out of their account and removed access to their dashboard till they login again and they will be sent to the homepage.[![u-Oj-DUD1-ASKi-XCl-URJb3-Msg.png](https://i.postimg.cc/J4FnXbgq/u-Oj-DUD1-ASKi-XCl-URJb3-Msg.png)](https://postimg.cc/3dgY5D34)
